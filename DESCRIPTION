Description: An implementation of the Elston-Stewart algorithm for calculating
    pedigree likelihoods given genetic marker data (Elston and Stewart (1971) 
    <doi:10.1159/000152448>). The standard algorithm is extended to allow inbred 
    founders. Mutation modelling is supported by the 'pedmut' package. 'pedprobr' 
    is part of the ped suite, a collection of packages for pedigree analysis in R, 
    based on 'pedtools' for handling pedigrees and markers.
