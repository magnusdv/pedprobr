Description: An implementation of the Elston-Stewart algorithm for
    calculating pedigree likelihoods given genetic marker data (Elston and
    Stewart (1971) <doi:10.1159/000152448>). The standard algorithm is
    extended to allow inbred founders. 'pedprobr' is part of the ped
    suite, a collection of packages for pedigree analysis in R, based on
    'pedtools' for handling pedigrees and markers. Mutation modelling is
    supported by the 'pedmut' package.
