## Introduction

The main content of **pedprobr** is an implementation of the Elston-Stewart algorithm for pedigree likelihoods. It is a reboot of the implementation in [paramlink](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=paramlink) which is no longer actively developed. 

**pedprobr** is part of the *ped suite*, a collection of packages for pedigree analysis in R, based on [pedtools](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedtools) for basic handling of pedigrees and marker data. In particular, **pedprobr** does much of the hard work in the [forrel](https://github.com/magnusdv/forrel) package for relatedness analysis and forensic pedigree analysis. 

The workhorse of the **pedprobr** package is the `likelihood()` function, which works in a variety of situations:

* complex inbred pedigrees
* pedigrees with inbred founders
* autosomal and X-linked markers
* a single marker or two linked markers
* markers with mutation models (supported by [pedmut](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedmut))

## Installation
To get the current official version of **pedprobr**, install from CRAN as follows:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("pedprobr")
```

Alternatively, you can obtain the latest development version from GitHub:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # install devtools if needed
devtools::install_github("magnusdv/pedprobr")
```

## Getting started
```{r}
library(pedprobr)
```

To set up a simple example, we first use **pedtools** utilities to create a pedigree where two brothers are genotyped with a single SNP marker. The marker has alleles `a` and `b`, with frequencies 0.2 and 0.8 respectively, and both brothers are heterozygous `a/b`.
```{r pedplot, fig.height=2.7, fig.width=2.5}
# Pedigree with SNP marker
x = nuclearPed(nch = 2) |> 
  addMarker(geno = c(NA, NA, "a/b", "a/b"), afreq = c(a = 0.2, b = 0.8))

# Plot with genotypes
plot(x, marker = 1)
```

The pedigree likelihood, i.e., the probability of the genotypes given the pedigree, is obtained as follows:
```{r}
likelihood(x, marker = 1)
```

## Genotype probability distributions
Besides `likelihood()`, other important functions in **pedprobr** are:

* `oneMarkerDistribution()` : the joint genotype distribution at a single marker, for any subset of pedigree members
* `twoMarkerDistribution()` : the joint genotype distribution at two linked markers, for a single person

In both cases, the distributions are computed conditionally on any known genotypes at the markers in question.

To illustrate `oneMarkerDistribution()` we continue our example from above, and consider the following question: **What is the joint genotype distribution of the parents, conditional on the genotypes of the children?** 

The answer is found as follows:
```{r}
oneMarkerDistribution(x, ids = 1:2, partialmarker = 1, verbose = F)
```

For example, the output confirms the intuitive result that the parents cannot both be homozygous for the same allele. The most likely combination is that one parent is heterozygous `a/b`, while the other is homozygous `b/b`.
